### Image Board – CactusImages

On the 8th week of Full Stack JavaScript Web Development coding bootcamp at SPICED, I build a single page, responsive image board, where users can upload, view and comment on images.

### Users can:

- Upload images with a description,

- Open a modal with a bigger image, where they can leave a comment

### Technologies used:

- Vue.js

- Node.js and Express.js

- PostgreSQL Database

- AWS S3 Image Storage

  ​

  This project was my first application built using  Vue.js. I also had an opportunity to get familiar with AWS S3.
